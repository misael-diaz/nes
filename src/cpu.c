	Background
	~~~~~~~~~~
	I love this microprocessor. It was at the heart of two of my favourite
	machines, the BBC Micro, and the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well
	as countless others in that era. I learnt to program on the Model B, and
	I learnt to love games on the NES, so in many ways, this processor is
	why I am the way I am today.

	In February 2019, I decided to undertake a selfish personal project and
	build a NES emulator. Ive always wanted to, and as such I've avoided
	looking at source code for such things. This made making this a real
	personal challenge. I know its been done countless times, and very likely
	in far more clever and accurate ways than mine, but I'm proud of this.
